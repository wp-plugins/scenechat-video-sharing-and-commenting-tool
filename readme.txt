SceneChat adds a social toolbar to the videos on your blog. It helps grow your traffic, boost site engagement and improve content discovery (SEO).


== Description ==


SceneChat adds time-specific commenting and social sharing capabilities to the videos on your blog. You can call attention to specific scenes within a video, enable your audience to leave comments at any point, indicate scenes they like, and share scenes with their friends on Facebook and Twitter. 

As a publisher focused tool, SceneChat is designed to drive traffic and engage users on your site, rather than on video portals or social networks. 

All user activity is recorded within SceneChat and displayed via easy to understand charts and graphs. Learn which content is attracting the most attention and which users are drawing in others.  Comments are indexable by search engines (SEO friendly). 

SceneChat helps grow your audience, boost website engagement and improve content discovery.

This WordPress Plugin represents SceneChat's Basic Service which is Free!
