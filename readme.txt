SceneChat adds an interactive social toolbar to the videos on your site. It
helps engage your audience, grow your traffic, and drive conversion.


== Description ==

SceneChat is a self-serve solution for marketers looking to increase video
engagement and conversions. The platform provides the easiest, most flexible
solution for creating, publishing and analyzing interactive social video
marketing campaigns - without the need for video editors or Flash developers.

SceneChat enables the creation of interactive experiences that can be synced
to specific scenes within a video, engaging audiences as they consume content.
Interactions can be timed messages or questions, graphics, URL links, polls,
or multiple choice questions that can navigate a video. With SceneChat,
marketers are able to design sophisticated interactions that engage audiences
at the best time during video consumption - providing scene-relevant
interaction that gathers data while driving conversions.

SceneChat experiences can be broadly distributed via Facebook or Twitter, or
directly embedded on a publisher's site or blog.  In addition, the company
offers both a WordPress plugin and on-site code that enables experiences to be
directly published onto a site.

A free trial is available enabling anyone to start  an account and instantly
create and deploy interactive videos for 30 days without restriction. After 30
days customers can continue using  the service for as little as $10 per month.
A "Forever-Free" option is available for users with less than 200 views per
month.
