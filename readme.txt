SceneChat adds a social toolbar to the YouTube and Vimeo videos on your site. It helps grow your traffic, boost site engagement and improve SEO.


== Description ==


SceneChat enables social engagement and promotion of the videos on your site. Now your visitors can comment on and share your videos with their social community via time-specific comments tied to specific scenes. Additionally, as the publisher you can add .Moderator pop-ups. that call-out specific points or moments. 

Clicking on a comment or a shared scene draws followers to that exact moment in the video. Add a SceneMark icon to give instant feedback whether you like (or dislike) a scene.

SceneChat was designed for publishers seeking to engage their audiences - enabling them to socially promote the videos on your site.

On the back-end, SceneChat captures all user activity and displays the results in easy to understand charts and graphs. Learn exactly which videos are attracting the most attention and which users are helping to spread the word. We even do our part to help with content discovery by making all comments indexable by search engines (SEO friendly).
