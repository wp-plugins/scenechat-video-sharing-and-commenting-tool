== Frequently Asked Questions ==


What is SceneChat?
SceneChat is a Social Video Sharing system designed for web publishers and bloggers. SceneChat adds a socialization drop-down to embedded videos on a site. This enables a site's audience to comment on, start discussions and share their favorite moments with their social network (or via email).


Why should I use SceneChat on my blog?
SceneChat provides an intuitive way for your audience to comment on and share the videos on your blog. It enables you to learn more about your audience, drive new traffic to your site, and lengthen engagement time.


We provide a publisher's portal where you can see analytics on which content is performing the best on your site as well as who your best content sharers are. 


Which video players does it support?
Our current beta supports YouTube. We expect to add additional players in subsequent releases such as Vimeo and JWPlayer. If you have a specific player drop us a line at info@scenechat.com


Is there a cost for the SceneChat service or plugin?
This current beta represents SceneChat's Basic Service. Basic Service is FREE and will always remain so. There is currently a high-ceiling limit on the amount of comments and click-backs a basic account can generate per month. We'll use this beta period to help determine usage tiers. We also plan to release higher-end features such as single-user sign on, look and feel customization, an API for tighter integration, as well as more detailed analytics. 


We expect to offer a tiered monthly fee - additional features start below $10/month, while the existing features remain free.
